# aiXplain-GuardianWave
aiXplain Agents created for the hackathon  - for the problem statement "Women's safety". 
We are four first-year Computer Science and Engineering students driven by a passion for making a difference. Women's safety is a cause close to our hearts as these are situations and thoughts we as women experience everyday. So, we are committed to using our skills to develop innovative solutions that contribute to a safer world.

How to navigate our application:
1) execute the main file women.py. A GUI will open.
2) Select the pipeline of your choice that you want help with.
3) Enter the input based on the pipeline selected and let the script load.
4) In the output console, kindly look for links that start with https://aixplain-modelserving-data.s3.amazonaws.com... and copy it. Paste these links in a browser window.
5) A .tmp file will be downloaded. Rename the extension to .doc, and open the file.
6) Voila! the solution will be visible in the Word document.
